Thesis is that none of the three words are good choices and likely picked clean out of the air.
There are literally more betting options for the color of the liquid that will be poured on the 
winning head coach than there is for a poet laureate reading an original poem. Lots of newness here.
First poem read at a Super Bowl, Gorman is young and has given just two public readings of poems.
There aren't any public anthologies of her work available for analysis (a book is upcoming).

It's understandable that hero is the favortie (plurals count) -- Gorman has already [publicly
referred to the three as such](https://twitter.com/TheAmandaGorman/status/1354902438587879424), 
but Gorman is also a sophisticated poet and starting off with talk of heroes -- while possible -- 
seems too on the nose. 

Some evidence is found for Pandemic via sentiment analysis. Hero and Super are both words with 
positive sentiment attached to them, and Pandemic is negative. Gorman has only performed two 
major poetry readings in her young career, but when combined, both follow a similar three act structure 
of starting off relatively neutral in terms of sentiment in the first third, then 
moving to a "dark night of the soul" in the second act, and finally finishing on a high note.
It seems likely that a massive national stage like the Super Bowl would lend itself to a
similar, well-established pattern for good storytelling. That being the case, fading 
the positive words may be the sharp play. So I make the case for Pandemic -- "pan" means
all and the theme of the peom given by the NFL is "It Takes All of Us".

A way to get an edge of sportsbook is to try and find correlated wagers. If we believe
that Pandemic will be the first word spoken, it follows that it may help us predict which of
the three "heroes" will be highlighted first. Suzie Dorner is a COVID ICU nurse and is a logical
choice for this. There are large uncertainties at play -- pandemic could be uttered first (among
the available choices) and Dorner highlighted second in the dark night of the soul portion of the poem, 
for instance.

Finally, there is a bet on which team name Gorman will utter first. Chefs seems an
odd favorite to be said by a woman who is in the business of choosing her words carefully and
who is deeply concerned with the issues of race and marginalization, particularly in this moment.
